# Maximizing_Mobile_App_Profits
Our data analysis project aims to identify profitable mobile app profiles on the App Store and Google Play markets. 
As a data analyst, I support our company in developing Android and iOS apps, empowering our developers to make data-driven decisions. 
Our focus is on creating free apps that generate revenue through in-app advertisements, making user attraction crucial for success. 
Through comprehensive data analysis, we seek valuable insights into the app types with a higher potential to captivate a larger user base.
